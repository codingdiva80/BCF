					So far, I have obtained about $50,000 in business credit. I am already on step five and it has only been a couple of months. 
					Thanks for all the help.</p>

					<p class="testimonials-p">I was thinking about starting a company a while back and signed up to start building my business credit. I found out during
					the process, that I could leverage my good personal credit and obtain good business credit faster than not using my personal
					credit. By doing this I was able to get enough money to start a local franchise company. Thanks for the help, I could not 
					have done it without you.</p>

					<p class="testimonials-p">I was really glad to find out that clients with an existing business, generating money with 
						good personal credit can achieve the best results. After hearing that, I signed up right away and am very happy 
						with the help and results to date. My business is now twice the size because of the loan you were able to help me 
						obtain. I was able to buy a second location. This is going to be a good year for us.</p>
